## Features

- Environment-aware logging (Server, Browser, Edge)
- Customizable log levels and environments
- Colored console output for server environments
- Full TypeScript support
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Zero external dependencies, leveraging Bun's all-in-one toolkit
- No side effects
- Built, tested, and bundled entirely with Bun

## Why Bun?

I've built nexlog using [Bun](https://bun.sh), an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed. Bun provides:

- Fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- Built-in bundler
- Integrated test runner
- Node.js-compatible package manager

By leveraging Bun's comprehensive toolkit, I've been able to develop, test, run, and bundle nexlog without any external dependencies. This ensures a lightweight, fast, and reliable logging solution for your Next.js projects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install nexlog
# or
yarn add nexlog
# or
bun add nexlog
```

## Usage

```typescript
import logger from 'nexlog';

// Set configuration (optional)
logger.setConfig({ level: 'info', enabledEnvironments: ['server', 'browser', 'edge'] });

// Log messages
logger.info('This is an info message');
logger.warn('This is a warning', { additionalInfo: 'Some extra data' });
logger.error('An error occurred', { errorCode: 500 });
```

### Output Example

Server environment:
```
[2024-03-15T12:34:56.789Z] [INFO] This is an info message
[2024-03-15T12:34:56.790Z] [WARN] This is a warning {"additionalInfo":"Some extra data"}
[2024-03-15T12:34:56.791Z] [ERROR] An error occurred {"errorCode":500}
```

Browser/Edge environment:
```
[2024-03-15T12:34:56.789Z] [INFO] This is an info message
[2024-03-15T12:34:56.790Z] [WARN] This is a warning {"additionalInfo":"Some extra data"}
[2024-03-15T12:34:56.791Z] [ERROR] An error occurred {"errorCode":500}
```

## API

### Methods

- `logger.trace(message: string | undefined, meta?: object)`
- `logger.debug(message: string | undefined, meta?: object)`
- `logger.info(message: string | undefined, meta?: object)`
- `logger.warn(message: string | undefined, meta?: object)`
- `logger.error(message: string | undefined, meta?: object)`
- `logger.fatal(message: string | undefined, meta?: object)`
- `logger.setConfig(config: Partial<NexlogConfig>)`
- `logger.getConfig(): NexlogConfig`
- `logger.resetConfig()`
- `logger.initConfig()`: Loads configuration from a file (server-side only).
- `logger.debugConfig()`: Outputs the current configuration for debugging purposes.

### Configuration

```typescript
interface NexlogConfig {
  level: LogLevel;
  enabledEnvironments: LogEnvironment[];
}

type LogLevel = "trace" | "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "fatal";
type LogEnvironment = "server" | "browser" | "edge";
```

## Environment Detection

nexlog automatically detects the current environment (server, browser, or edge) and adjusts its output accordingly. You can also manually set the environment or use helper functions for detection:

```typescript
import { setEnvironment, isServer, isNextEdgeRuntime } from 'nexlog';

if (isServer) {
  setEnvironment('server');
} else if (isNextEdgeRuntime) {
  setEnvironment('edge');
} else {
  setEnvironment('browser');
}
```

## Integration with Next.js 14.x

To integrate `nexlog` with a Next.js 14.x application, follow these steps:

1. **Install the library:**

   ```bash
   npm install nexlog
   # or
   yarn add nexlog
   # or
   bun add nexlog
   ```

2. **Configure the logger:**

   Create a `nexlog.config.js` or `nexlog.config.ts` file in the root of your project to define your logger configuration:

   ```javascript
   // nexlog.config.js
   module.exports = {
     level: 'info',
     enabledEnvironments: ['server', 'browser', 'edge'],
   };
   ```

3. **Initialize the logger in your Next.js application:**

   You can initialize the logger in your `layout.tsx` file:

   ```typescript
   import type { Metadata } from "next";
   import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
   import "./globals.css";
   import nexlog from 'nexlog';

   const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

   // Initialize the logger configuration
   nexlog.initConfig().then(() => {
     nexlog.info('Logger initialized');
   });

   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: "Create Next App",
     description: "Generated by create next app",
   };

   export default function RootLayout({
     children,
   }: Readonly<{
     children: React.ReactNode;
   }>) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```
   
4. **Use the logger throughout your application:**

   You can now use `nexlog` in any part of your Next.js application:

   ```typescript
   import nexlog from 'nexlog';

   export default function Home() {
     nexlog.debug('Rendering Home component');

     return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>;
   }
   ```

## Development

I use Bun as the all-in-one toolkit for this project. Here's how you can get started:

To install dependencies (although nexlog has none, this is for development purposes):

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

To build the project:

```bash
bun run build
```

## FAQ

### Does nexlog have any external dependencies?

No, I designed nexlog to be completely self-contained with zero external dependencies. By leveraging Bun's comprehensive toolkit, I've been able to develop, test, and bundle nexlog without relying on any third-party packages. This means you don't need to worry about compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities from external dependencies.

### Does nexlog have any side effects?

No, I carefully designed nexlog to avoid any side effects. It doesn't modify global objects or interfere with other parts of your application. This makes it safe to use in any part of your Next.js project without worrying about unexpected behavior.

### Why did you choose to build nexlog with Bun?

I chose Bun for its all-in-one approach to JavaScript/TypeScript development. Bun's integrated runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager allowed me to create nexlog with zero external dependencies. This results in a faster, more lightweight, and more reliable logging solution for Next.js projects.
